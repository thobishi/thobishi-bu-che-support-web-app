SchemaAnalyst plugin for CakePHP 1.3 - PUBLIC PREVIEW

Analyses database tables and connections.

Currently checking:
 - Database table field lengths.
 - Database table charset.
 - Database connection charset.

Next up:
 - Publishing test cases.
 - Checking primary index folowing Model::$primaryKey.
 - Checking indexes following model associations.
 - Checking unique indexes following isUnique validation rules.

DBO engines supported:
 - MySQL

Limited, because most of CakePHP's DBOs do not have the DboSource::index() 
method implemented. Not sure yet about the charsets, could be trouble too.

Test cases have been kept back, because they are a mess right now, I will
publish them when I have cleaned them up.

And please, don't post any issues yet. This plugin is still in development.
