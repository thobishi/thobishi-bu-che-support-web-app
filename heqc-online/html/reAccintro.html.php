Completing an application might take some time.
You do not need to complete the entire application form in a single session - you may come back to the online application as often as necessary.
<br><br>
To save data that you have entered, you may press either the "Save", "Next" or "Previous" buttons; or "Log out".
<br><br>
Once you are certain that the required sections of the form are complete, submit the application to the HEQC Directorate by clicking "Submit and Logout", which will appear after the last question on the application form.
<br><br>
<span class="visi">In the interests of expediting the processing of the application, you are asked to ensure that all questions are answered in full and that all relevant documentation is uploaded as requested. Failure to provide responses and/ or the relevant documentation will result in the application being returned or cancelled. </span>
