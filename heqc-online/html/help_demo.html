</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
	The high quality conceptualisation and design of a programme and its qualifications is the first step towards achieving high quality provision. Effective design policies and procedures ensure that programmes meet the needs of students and other stakeholders and are intellectually credible. The clear definition of the purpose of a programme and the exit level outcomes of its qualifications provide also key reference points against which the effectiveness of the programme and the performance of its students can be evaluated at a later stage. In the case of professional and work-based learning in professional programmes, input from stakeholders such as industry and professional bodies is critical.

Recruitment is the planned strategy to attract students to a particular programme. Recruitment as well as the processes of admission and selection of students need to be done taking into account certain national objectives. The promotion of equity of access and outcomes and the redress of past inequalities through ensuring that student, graduate profiles reflect the demographic composition of South African society is one of the DoE's strategic objectives for the transformation of the higher education system (NPHE: 2001: 3.2).

Staff competence and effectiveness 
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
Staff competence and effectiveness are critical for institutional performance.  An institution should provide incentives and resources for its staff to meet their own professional goals and to contribute to the realisation of the institution's mission.  Staff development should be part of an institution's human resource development strategy. Important aspects of staff development should include: dealing with 'non-traditional students', new understandings of teaching and learning and about demands of the knowledge society, which include capacity-building in research, and issues of academic management and leadership.

	Student assessment
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
Student assessment and success is a central indicator of teaching and learning effectiveness.  The transformation goals of widening access, improving retention and throughput rates and producing graduates with appropriate knowledge and skills, can be supported and directed by an effective assessment system.  Although the curriculum may target skills, knowledge and attitudes appropriate to the goals of social and economic transformation, if assessment procedures fail to prioritise and test these competences, students are unlikely to acquire the intended learning outcomes. Finally, assessment has a critical influence on the quality of teaching and learning and can be used as a powerful point of leverage for change and improvement in education.
