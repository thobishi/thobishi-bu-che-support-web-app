	<br>
	<p>The Higher Education Quality Committee (HEQC) of the Council on Higher Education (CHE) is responsible for the accreditation of higher education learning programmes by virtue of the provisions of the Higher Education Act, 101 of 1997 (as amended) and the National Qualifications Framework Act, 67 of 2008.</p>
	<p>Private Higher Education Institutions are required to register their institutions and programmes with the Department of Higher Education and Training. The registration period applies for a period of between three to five years, as determined by the Registrar of Private Higher Education. Prior to the expiry of the registration, the Registrar requests the CHE to confirm whether the Institution continues to meet the HEQC's Criteria for Accreditation. This process is commonly referred to as re-accreditation and it involves the verification of the quality of the programmes.</p>
	<p>The HEQC's Criteria for Accreditation specify minimum standards which provide guidelines for meeting the criteria.  Both the criteria and minimum standards should not be viewed as individual discrete requirements to be met. They should be viewed holistically as coherence and integration are important principles of programme accreditation. Programme design is a fundamental consideration in the evaluation of the programmes, underpinning a teaching and learning philosophy, model and approach. Ensuring that the programme is of an appropriate academic level and standard that meets the relevant NQF level and standards for the qualification is essential.</p>
	<p>The HEQC's programme accreditation criteria serve as quality indicators for institutions undertaking self-evaluations in preparation for re-accreditation of existing programmes.</p>
	The following principles guide the HEQC's programme accreditation model:
	<br>
	<ul>
		<li>Academic programmes in the higher education system should be of acceptable quality. Only those programmes which satisfy at least minimum quality requirements will be allowed to enter and remain in the higher education system.</li>
		<li>The primary responsibility for programme quality rests with higher education institutions themselves. Institutions should seek to establish and maintain effective mechanisms that facilitate programme quality and yield reliable information for internal programme-related planning and self-evaluation, external evaluation, and public reporting.</li>
		<li>The HEQC has a responsibility to the students and the public to endorse those programmes that are of acceptable quality and meet the criteria for accreditation.</li>
		<li>To ensure credible programme evaluations, the HEQC uses a system of peer review.</li>
	</ul>
